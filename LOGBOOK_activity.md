- imported data from csv to python into dataframes
- exported data to sql
- added the separator format and header line to csv imports so that they are properly separated into columns
- created function make_into_date(var1) to tranform dates in the format YYMMDD into python datetime objects and after sql datetime objects
- converted the date collumns date in acc_df, loan_dev_df and trans_dev_df as well as date collumn issued from card_dev_df with the previous functions
- made it so in function make_into_date(var1) if the month is greater than 12 50 is subtracted from it
- converted the date column birth_number into a propper date in table client_df
- used list comprehension to properly assign genders in client_df based on if the month of the date of birth is greater than 12
- fixed bug where sometimes python assumed incorectly that the year was in the 2000s instead of 1900s
